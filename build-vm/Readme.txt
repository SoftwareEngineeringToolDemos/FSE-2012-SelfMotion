When the machine starts eclipse and an android emulator should open. To use the demo, take the following steps:
1. Click on the run button in eclipse to install the app on the emulator and launch it

2. Click on "Share prices" to 'scan a barcode' to share a price of a product in the store.

3. Since the emulator cannot scan anything, hit 'esc' to manually enter in a product code. The app will then try to find your location to compare the prices of the product.
